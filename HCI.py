             **Technical Precondition:** Before you start make sure you are on the Home Screen, for that do a "Restart" on Figma iFrame (bottom right) or press key "R". When you press the Start Button the time will be recorded automatically. No worries, you do not have a given time to complete the task.
            
             **Be aware:** Please make sure that you are recording yourself (audio and screen). If necessary, we suggest to make a quick test.

             **Your Scenario:** You are a user of our energy saving challenge app. Our app is used to measure your every day electricity consumption. A new feature of our app are so-called "energy challenges".

             **Your Task:** Your Task is to create a new challenge in the app. In this specific case you want to make an energy challenge against "Geralt of Rivia" in terms of light consumption.

             **Your Task summarized:** Make a challenge against Geralt of Rivia in terms of "Lights". The task is finished, when you see your challenge added to the board. You will see a screen telling you, that you are done.

             **Remark I:** Please know that your participation is completely voluntary and that you can end the experiment at any time.

             **Remark II:** You are testing the system and not you, so you can‚Äôt do anything wrong. PLease also be aware, that you are provided a prototype.

             **Remark II:** This website will guide you through the experiment.

             **Remark III:** If the Figma in the next step is not working, please try to use another browser.

             **Remark IV:** With clicking the "Understood"-Button, please make sure you are recording. Let the experiment begin.

             **Time recording: ** You will receive a figma image in the middle of the task flow. In order to measure the time you take for the experiment, we need you to press the letter "r" to begin the task.

             **Last Remark:** Please help us with our experiment with thinking out loud. We know this might feel akward in the beginning, but would be massive help for us. Thank you!
